This is a continuation of my trekking photojournal series -- this time trekking through the Annapurna region. The trails were mostly clear, but we met several Nepali groups -- either taking a break from school, enjoying Holi, or just out walking the beautiful rhododendron forests around the Poon Hill area -- something I have always wanted to do since arriving in Nepal so I was very happy to be able to see them in their full glory.

It was kind of surreal -- like a parallel universe surrounded by Nepal's national flower instead of the Cherry Blossoms of D.C. during peak bloom. And, instead of walking the clean swamp in intense pollen-filled air, otherwise pristine, we walked in the smog filled forests at the foot of the Himalaya due to all of the [wildfires across this arid country](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/asia/nepal-wildfires-air-quality-intl-hnk/index.html) -- something like the _Upside Down_ of _Stranger Things_.

Our planned 4-day trek by color.

We completed it in 3 and spent the extra afternoon + evening in Pokhara. [My analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ezitz2lknT8BgWa4n5KweX-axYwXOBD5zSmCERTa1y8/edit?usp=sharing) showed that it would be a bit more difficult day-by-day (in terms of elevation gain per mile) than our Langtang trek a couple of weeks back, but it actually seemed a lot easier. When I looked at the Garmin data, it showed that the elevation gain was significantly overestimated as we ended up climbing ~39% less than estimated. Combined with the elevation being under ~10,000 feet the entire time, ~11 miles less distance, and having built up my trekking tolerance :sweat_smile:, it was a breeze! Definitely an awesome beginner trek as is touted. What I was most impressed with was how precise my estimate of the total trek time was -- 16 hours and 50 minutes actual vs. 17 hours predicted. _That's within 1%!_ Here are the actual Garmin daily logs:

- [Day 2: Ulleri to Ghorepani](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/6511121064)
