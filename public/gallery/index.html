The Tharu people are an ethnic group indigenous to the Terai in southern Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>The word <em>थारू</em> <em>thāru</em> is thought to be derived from sthavir meaning follower of Theravada Buddhism.</p>
<p>The Tharu people themselves say that they are a people of the forest. In Chitwan, they have lived in the forests for hundreds of years practicing a short fallow shifting cultivation. They plant rice, wheat, mustard, corn and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses; hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharu_people">Source</a>.</p>
