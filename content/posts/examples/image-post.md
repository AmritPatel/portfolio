Hello! I'm a blog post with an image. Thanks to Open Graph and Twitter metadata, external links to this page will feature the image below.

![This is an example caption.](/posts/passing/000528810023-min.jpg)

To make this happen, set the `images` parameter in your post's [front-matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), like this YAML example:

```yaml
images:
    - /posts/ideas.png
```
