A photojournal trekking through the _Langtang Valley_ in March of 2021. There were practically no travelers due to the COVID-19 pandemic so it was a unique chance to explore without the heavy traffic common during 1 of the 2 main tourist seasons. The locals have been hit hard economically, but they are managing and even completing renovations to gear up for the Fall tourist season.

## Day 1: _Syafrubesi_ to _Bamboo_

{{< image-resize langtang-1.jpg "1024x" >}}

No escape. 6 hours from _Kathmandu_ to _Syafrubesi_ by jeep. Chris and I were 2 of 4 people crammed in this back seat -- literally on top of each other.

Buying cheese at the _Kyanjin_ Cheese Factory after sampling the unique taste of both aged and new yak cheeses. Read [_The story of Langtang cheese_](https://www.nepalitimes.com/banner/the-story-of-langtang-cheese/) about the history of this awesome facility.

## Day 4: _Kyanjin_ to _Syafrubesi_ via _Sherpagaun_

Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ. "Thus the six syllables, om mani padme hum, mean that in dependence on the practice of a path which is an indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha[...]" —H.H. Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama. [_Source_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_mani_padme_hum).

Sea Buckthorne shrub beginning to turn color and bud. A unique and flavorful juice is made from its berries in this region.

Snacking on yak cheese while enjoying my first warm cup of Sea Buckthorn juice. Shortly we will end our descent and begin our ascent to _Sherpagaun_ to check out different scenery on our return to _Syafrubesi_.

One of several rushes of "honkeys". Best to get to high ground when you hear the bells getting louder.

{{< image-resize langtang-78.jpg "1024x" >}}

Passing through _Sherpagaun_. We originally planned to stay the night here, but decided to head back down for a more efficient return to _Kathmandu_ early in the morning to beat traffic and avoid having to take the local bus.

Peaking out the entryway of the Malla Hotel in _Syafubesi_ waiting for a jeep to take us back to _Kathmandu_.
