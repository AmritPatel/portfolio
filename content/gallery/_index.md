### Around the village of Sauraha

![Typical Tharu guest house.](/gallery/chitwan/IMG_20191202_0040.jpg)
The Tharu people are an ethnic group indigenous to the Terai in southern Nepal and northern India.

The word _थारू_ _thāru_ is thought to be derived from sthavir meaning follower of Theravada Buddhism.

The Tharu people themselves say that they are a people of the forest. In Chitwan, they have lived in the forests for hundreds of years practicing a short fallow shifting cultivation. They plant rice, wheat, mustard, corn and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses; hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes.
