This is my response to the KTM Series (short for Kathmandu Trail Race Series) rebrand campaign. The request was for a catchy and interesting name that doesn't include terms like "race", "run", "challenge", "competition", or locations like "Kathmandu" or "KTM", etc.

What I came up with:

- Beyond the Trail
- Beyond the Bato
- TrailMandala
- Trailvana (my favorite)

I also took the opportunity to practice my graphic design skills. I found a [photo taken in the _Himalayas_](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gadventures.com%2Fmedia-server%2Fdynamic%2Fblogs%2Fposts%2Fpeter-west-carey%2F2017%2F01%2FPeter-West-Carey-Nepal2013-1011-6829feature.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gadventures.com%2Fblog%2Fnight-photography-himalayas%2F&tbnid=_pPjvaKnXvngcM&vet=12ahUKEwi6tpHw8qzvAhUHUFMKHQrsBAwQMygOegQIARBU..i&docid=iLIGPOHAEON-rM&w=2048&h=1151&q=running%20nepal&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwi6tpHw8qzvAhUHUFMKHQrsBAwQMygOegQIARBU) with a [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) license.

Next I ran the photo through the [deepart.io](https://deepart.io/img/uu2bc0Fq/) AI engine to render a computer-generated artistic interpretation of the photo based on the given style.

Several hours of polyline tracing and applying Word Art in Google Drawing using one of the proposed names listed above resulted in the following vector-based image.
