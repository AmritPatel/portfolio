Before coming to Nepal, I had no idea what futsal was, but I have to say that it is way more fun than standard soccer. You get so many more touches on the ball and you are forced to think, act, and move quickly as you are constrained on a field about the size of a basketball court. We play twice a week, but I would play every day if I could.

I'm so lucky that this is a 5 minute bike ride from my home. This game has saved me during the pandemic.

This is the first time Kiran has come to watch and he was excited to gather a bit of footage -- grateful for that. Maybe I can wear a body cam next time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
